# Computationally Efficient Design of Directionally Compliant Metamaterials

Lucas A. Shaw, Frederick Sun, Carlos M. Portela, Rodolfo I. Barranco, Julia R. Greer, and Jonathan B. Hopkins 

These three MATLAB files constitute a software that enables the design of directionally compliant metatmaterials (DCMs). The master file, MaterialDesignGUI.m, contains the design tool’s functions. The file, MaterialDesignGUI.fig, contains the content necessary to launch the graphical user interface (GUI). The file, images.mat, contains various images required for the GUI. Please click on the following link or paste the universal resource locator (URL) directly into a browser to download the three required files. Once they have been downloaded, put them all into the same folder on your computer and click on the MaterialDesignGUI.m file to open it with MATLAB. Once the file is open, run it to launch the tool.
